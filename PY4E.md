# PY4E - Python for Everybody (The University of Michigan Online, MOOC)
## Course Objectives
- This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. 
  - We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  
  - The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. 
  - Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. 
  - Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. 
- This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. 
  - We will explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis.
- This course will show how one can treat the Internet as a source of data.  
  - We will scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.  
  - We will work with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. 
- This course will introduce students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort.  
  - The course will use SQLite3 as its database.  
  - We will also build web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and visualization processes.  
  - We will use the D3.js library to do basic data visualization. 
- In the capstone, students will build a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python.
  - The projects will involve all the elements of the course.  
  - Students will do some visualizations to become familiar with the technologies in use and then will pursue their own project to visualize some other data that they have or can find.

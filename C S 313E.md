# C S 313E - Elements of Software Design (The University of Texas at Austin)
## Course Objectives
- The emphasis of this course is on software development using object-oriented methodology. 
- This course includes how to design software, how to create reusable software components, and how to compose programs from already available components. 
- Furthermore, students learn about some basic data structures and algorithms and how to match the data structures and algorithms to problems.

- In this course you will learn how to solve computational problems. Given a computational
problem you should be able to:
  - 1. Analyze (understand in detail) the problem
  - 2. Design an algorithm to solve the problem. In this design process you will choose the
appropriate data structure and the most efficient algorithm
  - 3. Implement the learned algorithm in Python 3
  - 4. Write your own test cases to test your algorithm. You will pay careful attention to edge
cases. Make sure that the output matches the format as specified.
